          language design principles and critique the various contenders from the perspective of 
          predicability, usability, and consistency. How will your favorite language hold up?

          Most people think of P2P networks as just a playground for file sharing applications, but it

          enhanced privacy and security. Using the example of building a cloud file storage system
          (think Dropbox) that instead runs on a P2P network, we’ll walk through the process of
          building an increasingly complex system to touch on topics such as scaling a network’s size
          and preserving data without a database.

        description: |
          Did you know Apple was teaching kids to code before it was cool? In this talk I'll revisit
          [Cocoa](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3m7zeuva26t4u2/Advanced%20Cocoa%20Tutorial.pdf?dl=0),
          the "internet programming" environment that Apple built for kids in the late 90s. I'll
          fire up a Mac OS 7 emulator and show what made Cocoa so groundbreaking. I'll explain
          how "programming by demonstration" and "actor-based" educational environments lower the

        description: If you know code, are fascinated with electronics, but don’t know the first thing
                     about circuits, this is for you. Modern microcontrollers make it easy to bring your
                     code out of the digital and into the physical. In this talk, we'll dive deep into
                     my first maker project called "Sharknicorn" -- a 3D printed unicorn horn on a shark hat
                     that has light animations depending on the realtime state of your Uber ride! We'll be going over
                     the basics of microcontroller programming along the way and some tools you can use to get started.
                     I hope this session will inspire you to scratch that maker itch and start your own project!
                     Let’s pick up our soldering irons and put on safety goggles — it’s time to make things.

          Regular expressions are one of the most mind-boggling programming techniques, but much of their mystery can be elucidated by tracking down how they made it into JavaScript in the first place.
          In this talk, I’ll tell the story of the regular expression, from its humble linguistic origins to its awe-inspiring power in modern programming languages like JavaScript.
          Once I reveal to the audience the linguistic theory behind regular expressions, they’ll feel empowered to start writing some of their own.

          estimate. We beat ourselves up over it when we get them wrong. In
          my past I've been an engineer, a lead, a product manager and
          engineering manager. This is my perspective on when/why they matter
          and when they don't. I also have a few tips for delivering estimates,
          when you actually need to give them. Hopefully, I'll deliver this
          presentation in the alotted timeframe 😎.

          Practical Things You Can Do to Protect the Privacy of Your Users
        description: |
          Protecting privacy is the right thing to do. Consider especially that
          a few of your users may be people such as political dissidents or
          victims of domestic abuse that are especially vulnerable to privacy
          violation. Protecting privacy also makes business sense. You want to
          protect against a big data breach that could destroy your company's
          reputation, or to comply with upcoming European privacy regulations
          that apply to all apps worldwide. However privacy can be hard to get a
          handle on, because it is often explained using legal jargon. In this
          talk I speak as a fellow developer and outline the practical
          engineering things you can do, concentrating on protecting data you
          store in your backends.

        description: If you’ve ever written code with other people,
          you’ve probably had to fix bugs with other people—and
          sometimes that’s the hardest part. When your logs have expired,
          you can’t reproduce the issue, and you’ve tested five different
          hypotheses, maybe it’s time to give someone else a shot. But
          what's the best way to do that? I’ll talk about the workflow I
          use to collaboratively debug issues without repeating work or
          losing progress and why it makes sense.

          "Works for Me": Understanding Privilege in Tech
        description: |
          "Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed. "Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't inaccurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others. This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

            teaching? Let’s talk about how “mathsteps” uses code to step through
            algebra problems, how these algorithms were designed with teaching
            in mind, and why it’s so awesome that this project is open-source!

        title: Web Assembly, Numeric Computing, and the Future of the Web
        emoji: 🔩🔮
        description:
          WebAssembly, a new portable compilation target for the web, promises
          to radically change how we build web applications. In this talk, I
          will provide an overview of WebAssembly and its current implementation
          status. I will next walk through a brief step-by-step example which
          involves compiling low-level BLAS libraries to WebAssembly for high-
          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

          I'm a huge fan of mood lighting and app reliability. Related? Of
          course!  I heard about Progressive Web Apps and thought it was a
          great way to make web applications more accessible, so I wanted to
          give it a try. (Disclaimer🤓  I don't think PWAs are going to replace
          mobile apps just yet, but I do think they're a great way to make our
          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to
          create an application that let me control Philips Hue lights. That
          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable
          lights. So, if I went outside to enjoy my yard, on the roof to hang
          out with friends, or WaffleJS to chill with amazing people, I could
          easily set the appropriate mood lighting with my app.  I would like
          to share my experience with all of you and show off my new toys 😊

        title: Why React is so Fast
        emoji: 🤔
        description:
          React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library
          designed to manage the view layer of complex UIs. In recent
          years, it has established itself as the dominant library for
          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk
          is intended to be accessible to all audiences!

          not a matter swapping out one service for another, it requires that we
          rethink many of our assumptions about trust and infrastructure. It requires
          that we build a lot more open source software infrastructure to make the
          basic tools like signing and encryption as usable as we've made the rest
          of our software infrastructure.

          transitioned from waterfall to XP, scaled our team to be globally distributed,
          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          You’re so pumped. You found an API that will bring

          The next day, you want to flip a table because
          nobody knows how to use this API. Stack Overflow
          has failed you. Documentation is clearly a novella
          rather than being straightforward. What do you do?
          Do you just give up and build from scratch? No!
          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these
          situations. Like Nancy Drew, you can hunt down the

          animations, and learn more about the different types of front end animations,
          what their limitations are, and how to choose between them.

        description: |
          This talk looks beyond origami as a childhood
          pastime and an art form and explores origami
          as a source of many interesting mathematical
          problems, including one called the
          fold-and-cut problem. The fold and cut theorem
          states that it is possible, given a piece of
          paper and any polygonal shape, to find a
          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.
          This talk explores a proof of the theorem and
          an implementation of a solver that determines
          the correct series of folds given any input
          polygon. There will be a live demo of the
          program and paper cutting!
